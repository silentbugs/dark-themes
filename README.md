# Dark Themes

> Welcome to the dark side. Inspired by https://github.com/radibit/jira-dark-theme, this repo provides very basic dark themes for websites I use a lot.

## Description

Simple Chrome extension, that applies dark theme to a list of websites.

## Installation

Download the code or clone the repo, activate developer mode in `chrome://extensions`,
and load the extension using `Load unpacked extension`.

I don't have any plans to publish this extension at the moment.

## Building

Themes written in LESS CSS, you can use the builtin "build.sh" script or read it to generate a single css file that applies the themes. The built version of CSS (css/main.css) is also included for easy usage.
